## Finding Friends

Its your first semester on a new campus and you are wanting to put yourself out there but you still haven't really met anyone yet. How would you get together with enough people to play a game of basketball? Enter Manoa Fitness Finder.

It also allows you to add other people who share similar interests and see what events they having that are coming up.

In addition I assisted with smaller features that were technologically challenging or that challenges that individual group members were having.
