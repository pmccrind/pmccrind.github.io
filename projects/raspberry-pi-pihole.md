## My Role
The raspbery pi's were given to the potential receipants of a scholarship funded by the NSF. During the week long screening process we had to setup, configure, and as a group add a service that assited the other members. My contribution was setting my DNS based ad-blocking to deny as many requests as possible to ensure priority traffic such as video game streaming and a plex server as much bandwith as possible. I used Pi-Hole to accomplish this.

## The Difficulties

* Setting up Raspberry Pi - The raspberry pi can be used right out of the box but we were instructed to assembly it in the provided case and with the heat sinks. Another hardware related issue was the physical connectors on the pi and my laptop were not ##.
* Pi Hole - 
* Bash Scripting -

## My Solution

* The heat sinks were reletively easy to install and setup but the case was not. It was unintuitive that the top must be put on before the middle and then lastly the bottom. Failing to do so would result in too much pressure being put on the power plug potentially rendering the device useless.
* The Second
