## My Role
The raspbery pi's were given to the potential receipants of a scholarship funded by the NSF. During the week long screening process we had to setup, configure, and as a group add a service that assited the other members. My contribution was setting my DNS based ad-blocking to deny as many requests as possible to ensure priority traffic such as video game streaming and a plex server as much bandwith as possible. I used Pi-Hole to accomplish this.

## The Difficulties
