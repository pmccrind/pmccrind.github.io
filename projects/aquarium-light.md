## The Problem

Aquariums are a great way to make your home feel more like home. Setting up all the equipment for it can be a bit of a headache. Getting the light positioned the right distance away from the top of water line is key to making the aquarium thrive. Installing the light is another matter.

## First Ideas Aren't Always Winners

The first install was with a bracket crafted out of pipe and metal straps were used to attach it to the wall. The section sticking up are were the cables were attached at allow for the light to hang down at the correct height. The part on the floor would was secured to the wall to ensure it hold the light. 

## Second Time's the Charm

Not wanting to deal with concrete and wall tapcon screws anothera second mounting method was implemented to make it easier to setup and take down in case it needs to be moved again.

## The Difficulties

* Concrete - Itâ€™s a great building material but when trying to attach screws to it can be a negative that is so hard. Initially a drill driver and hammer drill was used. This proved to be ineffective and drill would have to be returned for a full refund.
* The light needed to be "floated" above the tank without being attached to the tank or to the wall. 

## The Solution

* A corded hammer drill with a larger motor made quick work of placing hole in the wall. After drilling the holes for the pipe ties the bracket was hung up and screwed into place. TapCon screws ensured that the bracket would break before the screws came out of the wall. 
* A large five shelf shelving unit was purchased as it is larger than the base of the stand that the tank is sitting on. The lowest shelf was place slightly above the optimal hanging height and another one was place on the top. The light was then attached with cable on each corner to keep it level and secure.
