## Putting Your Work on Display
As the say goes no one knows you better than you know yourself. That makes you the best person to market yourself to others. There tons of resources built to showcase your work, for example if you’re a tattoo artist maybe Instagram is your best way. If you in a more professional atmosphere then you can’t go wrong with LinkedIn, just about everyone already has or has it in conjunction with other social media platforms. These options give you plenty of choices on how to fill out and setup your profile but what if you didn’t like those options? Instead you could make your own portfolio and link people to all your social media in one fell swoop. Your skills as a programmer also get put on display by demonstrating how you can stylize and format the pages to your liking.

## JavaSrcipt > Java
My pervious programming skills initially gave me a distaste for JavaScript. JavaScript for me was a language you learn to make websites interactive. It also seemed strange that a triple equality would even be needed, but after learning any data type could be put into an array it began to make more sense. It still is far removed in programming but not in name from Java. After my initial crash course with the language I am glad that I am learning it and look forward to learning more about it as a whole.

## Looking Behind the Curtain
I had no interest in making webpages and spending hours and hours making the site just so, just to have the site be changed by a meeting’s decision to change everything about it. It seemed quantifiable in the sense that you can see your work day to day with people being able to view your webpages but it just failed to pique my interest. Learning how it and in a boarder sense the rest of the internet works is interesting. Additionally, as I dive further into this topic I hope to learn more about how CSS, HTML and JavaScript interact with one another.
