## Shattered Love
Her smile, her radiant beaming smile. <br/>
She loved every animal. <br/>
Free spirited often to a fault, <br/>
her chase of the next mountain <br/>
made her not see the next valley.<br/>

The skid marks on her arms outnumber,  <br/>
my willingness to be hurt. <br/>
Shapeshifting into a fiending creature, <br/>
I don’t recognize this monster. <br/>
Her smile filled with too many teeth, <br/>
causing even animals to growl in her presence.<br/>

She lies in the valley now, <br/>
with her new-found friends. <br/>
Each day mirrored from the last, <br/>
looking for the next mountain top, <br/>
in the river of her arm.<br/>
