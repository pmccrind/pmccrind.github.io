## Changing Perspective

This is it! I’m in! he thought, as he waited his turn. He had been trying to get her attention for the better part of a year. She always brushed him off saying that he wasn’t cool enough or that he didn’t wear the right clothes. With a change of wardrobe and a few rumors that he started about how he was into drinking and smoking weed, he was able to get her attention. “Your turn, big guy,” she said, playfully. He took the lighter and small phallic-shaped pipe in his hands and hoped he wouldn’t embarrass himself. Come on this is what you have been working towards, he thought. As he simultaneously lit the pipe and took a deep breath, a surge of endorphins immediately overloaded his brain. As his brain began to shut down, he melted into the couch and all of reality and time warped around him. He had never noticed just how nice the couch had felt. From the bottom of the couch he stared at the ceiling, his eyes slowly closed, and his breathing quickened. As time slowed down she lowered her face towards his and asked, “How’s it feel?” A wave of hair-raising adrenaline flowed through him from the hairs on his head all the way to his toes. Suddenly, filled with more energy than he ever had in his life, his eyes jerked open and he jumped up from the couch screaming, “I’m the king of the world!” He slammed open the front door and began to run across the street. Car horns blared and the screeching of tires echoed. He tripped over the curb and gashed his knee against the hard pavement, exposing the bone. As a chunk of skin flapped in the wind he wiped the blood off with his sleeve, jumped up, and ran the rest of the way home leaving a trail of blood along the way. Thirty years later… “I had been trying to get with this girl,” he said, talking through his hands. “I thought that this would get her to like me.” “She forced you to do it?” the man in the white coat asked. “No. No. I.. I wanted this,” he said.  His eyes began to water, making his eyes look like glass. “I grabbed the... the… the pipe. I remember thinking this was going to be the best day of my life, you know? Something to be remembered,” he said tearfully. “I took the hit. I took it!” He dropped his head between his knees, sniffing loudly as snot attempted to escape his nose. “Take your time, but tell me how it made you feel,” the doctor said, grabbing a tissue. Drying his eyes on his sleeve, he said, “I felt joy like I had never felt before. Like I was on cloud nine. I could have run a damn marathon! I felt so good. I remember running. I can’t remember where to, but I remember scaring my mother from all the damn blood.” “Blood?” the doctor asked, as he scribbled something down discreetly. “Yeah I tripped and cut my knee so damn bad I had to get ten stitches. Didn’t heal for three weeks! Almost had to have surgery,” he said, chuckling. “Anyway doc, that’s the first day I did meth.”


## Shattered Love
Her smile, her radiant beaming smile. <br/>
She loved every animal. <br/>
Free spirited often to a fault, <br/>
her chase of the next mountain <br/>
made her not see the next valley.<br/>

The skid marks on her arms outnumber,  <br/>
my willingness to be hurt. <br/>
Shapeshifting into a fiending creature, <br/>
I don’t recognize this monster. <br/>
Her smile filled with too many teeth, <br/>
causing even animals to growl in her presence.<br/>

She lies in the valley now, <br/>
with her new-found friends. <br/>
Each day mirrored from the last, <br/>
looking for the next mountain top, <br/>
in the river of her arm.<br/>
