## Think before you Ask

It is something that you do everyday. In a high stress enviroment the response needed is often immediate. In an email it can be a bit longer to allow your thoughts to fully devolp from point to point and get the meat of what it is you are really asking. The point remains you ask questions every single day. Personally I think about what I need in a satisfactory response and whom I should ask to get the answer the fastest, but I never thought about how I should be asking my question. It is beneficail for both myself and the poor person who I had the unfortunate nature of badgering with my question to think about what I want to ask. This saves us both time and frustrastion going back and forth trying to get to the bottom of it. By showing my thought process with what I have done or haven't done it shows that I have put the time in to try, really try to get to my head wrapped around this issue. Below is a question that was asked in a thoughtful way showing the thought process and what they really dying to know. The other not so much.
