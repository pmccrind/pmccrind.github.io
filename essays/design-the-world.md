Design is not my passion however, patterns do pique my interest. The weird crossover between something that makes me turn up my nose, and something I notice everyday is unquie. Figuring out a pattern in a seemingly random string of numbers is satisfying, if only I thought that design was.

## Design by Fire

As is the case with many things in life, the best way to learn what doesn't work is to try. The same holds true for design patterns. While some models seem purpose built for their use cases others need to be implemented to see when you want to use them. While I myself have not broke any ground into making a new design pattern I have figured out what works for me. Asking for someone to review my design choices.
 
 
 ## Ask and You Shall Receive, Maybe
 
 When asking for someone's opinion in general it's critical to get someones passionate answer.  If I largely get an echo chamber response of 'Looks good.' or 'I don't see anything wrong with it.' then I keep asking until I a strong response. From the strong negative or positive response you can determine what's working and what isn't.
 
 A caveat to this is User Interface (UI) design. Bad UI design sticks out like a sore thumb to almost everyone who uses it but may not be so evident to the person designing it. It's only after going through an alpha and beta test run with a lot users that you can design something that feels like it should. This makes get strong passionate response's easy, but then you must filter the noise from actual reasonable complaints.


## Design Up

With my humble beginnings into programming being from a Java perspective the design model I am the most comfortable with is the structural design pattern.  From an object-oriented programming perspective, it just seems to be an intuitive way to lay out your classes. The obvious downside being the amount of blood, sweat, and tears that need to be put in to ensure your base class works for all sub-classes you plan on creating. This makes it difficult to make changes without re-inventing the wheel for the whole structure if/when your super class needs to be expanded to include the new class you want to create.

## Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be

No one design pattern is the best. None are good in all scenarios that will come about in your application. The best applications use a mixture of different design patterns to achieve the best possible look and feel. Certainly a site will use a primary design pattern as the default to give the site a homogeneous feel, but it simply will not work for all scenarios and edge cases that will come on in the finished product.
