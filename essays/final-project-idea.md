# The Problem

In this unqiue situation the world finds itself in people are now more than ever are trying to find a new sense of normal. Part of maintaining normalcy is for students to continue to earn their degrees. For some classes they may be able to do with this without outside assitance, but for others it may be extermely diffucult. 

# My Solution

Enter Stay Home and Study(SHS). SHS is a one stop shop for studying and online tuturing needs. Each user creates a profile with a list of classes they need help with and classes they can help others with. This allows for either, the student with the knowledge to setup meetings at times that best suits them, or for the person who needs help to submit a request for help with a spefic subject. The request for help will go out to the people who have stated they would be willing to help with that subeject. It will also inform the user of campus specifc tools that are holding sessions for classes they need help with. Ie if the Learning Assitance Center has a tutor for a class you need help with a schedule will be provide on you home page with the online meetup times/links.
